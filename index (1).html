	<h1>Elaine Shang Guan</h1>

	<p>Computers serve a rather large role in my current lifestyle right now, especially with the new quarter system this year. Rather than spending time with friends or playing sports outside, I have been using the internet more and more. I really love listening to j-pop and reading manga in my spare time, and I also play the piano (started around 9 years ago), and the flute, which I'm in the Byng Arts program for. I play sports (not as usual now that the pandemic hit) such as badminton, swimming and figure skating, which I used to do competitively but now just as a hobby. I generally enjoy anything music or video game related and I spend a lot of my free time on my computer, whether doing homework or browsing the internet. I find computers really interesting, especially since I love playing video games. I'm interested in learning more about computer programming and how different games and programs are developed (and maybe try to create games from scratch in the future). I would also like to learn more about the history and development of PC's and the contributions people have made towards them.</p>
